## About
Voice is a simple, user-focused audiobook player where I explore new technologies, design ideas, and coding practices. It’s built to be intuitive, reliable, and an all-around joy to use.

## Current Status
**Note:**  
I’m currently unable to review or accept pull requests (PRs) due to life and work commitments. The project remains in "soft maintenance" mode. Bug reports and suggestions are welcome, but PRs may not receive a response for the foreseeable future. Thank you for your understanding!
