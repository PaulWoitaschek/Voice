### Why doesn't Voice support the xyz Media Format?

Voice relies on the media formats that are natively supported by the Android platform.

You can review the currently supported file extensions [here](https://developer.android.com/media/media3/exoplayer/supported-formats).
If a file that should be supported is not displayed, it is most likely either corrupted or incompatible with your Android version.

### Why isnâ€™t feature xyz available in the app?

I adhere to a core design principle of minimalism. As such, the app will only include settings and UI components that are absolutely
essential.
