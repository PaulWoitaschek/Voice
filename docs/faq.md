# Why doesn't Voice support xyz Media Format?

Voice uses the media formats supported by the Android platform.

You can see the currently supported media types [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/media-formats.html#core). If a file does
not show up even though it should its most likely damaged or not supported by your version of Android at all.

# Why isn't feature xyz in the app?

My first design principle is minimalism. So no setting / UI component that I don't think is absolutely necessary will reach the app.
