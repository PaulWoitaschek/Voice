## Ktlint

Voice uses **Ktlint** to enforce consistent code formatting.

- Check for formatting issues:

```sh
./gradlew lintKotlin
```

- Auto-fix formatting:

```sh
./gradlew formatKotlin
```

- To make commits fail on formatting errors, set up a pre-commit hook:

```sh
echo "./gradlew lintKotlin" > .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## Releasing

To release a new version:

1. Update versionCode and versionName in libs.versions.toml.
2. Push a corresponding Git tag to the main branch.

This triggers the CI to build and publish the release to the Play Storeâ€™s internal track. From there, promotion to production must be done
manually.

F-Droid builds are handled by their team and usually appear a few days after a stable (non-RC) release.
