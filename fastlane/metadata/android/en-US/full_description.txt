Are you looking for a simple, minimal audiobook player that just works?
One that lets you focus on what you actually want to do: Listen to audiobooks?
You simply add your main audiobook folder, and each folder in it is recognized as a single book. This keeps your library simple and uncluttered.

What it can do:
- Remembers the last position
- Set playback speed
- Beautiful material design
- Day & night theme. Easy on the eyes
- Bookmarks
- Android Auto
- Sleep Timer. No need to turn off the player in the middle of the night.

Voice is free and open source. This means that everyone can see what it does. It uses minimal permissions.
